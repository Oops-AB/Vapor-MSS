    The Backend application has a REST based API for retrieving and storing the different Model objects. 
    <br>
    It is using the FrontBase SQL92 database engine for storage. The adapter to Frontbase is for now kept 
    on a private git server, it is based on 3 frameworks the CFrontbaseSupport framework, Frontbase framework
    and FluentFrontbase (The Migration part is not included yet so there has to be tables befor running the 
    application).
    <br>
    Models that are included right now is only the User.
    In the future there will probably be an API for business functions also.
